## Task 1 - Basic image processing with OpenCV
- [x] Requirements
- Add default variable parameters for easy settings
- [x] Draw shapes and text using cv2 methods like in the examples
  - The locations and parameters are hard-coded to somewhere in the image
- [x] Draw date and time with `datetime`
- [x] Save the image with `cv2.imwrite(filename, img)`

Result:
<img width="686" height="430" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7204971-fd37-42f4-af2c-d4f7417881a0" />
